Solar Eclipse Data Analysis
Overview
This project is dedicated to analyzing Verizon subscriber behavior during the solar eclipse event. By leveraging various data sources, including subscriber location data, data usage statistics, and interactions with Points of Interest (POIs) across multiple cities, the project provides insights into how major events like solar eclipses affect network usage and subscriber behavior. The analysis includes data processing, visualization, and reporting, with the goal of understanding trends and optimizing network performance during large-scale events.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains raw and processed data files used for analysis.
scripts/: Includes Python scripts for data processing and visualization.
output/: Stores the generated outputs, such as plots and maps.
README.md: Project documentation.
Eclipsevisual.py: The main script used for generating visualizations and analysis.
Data
The data used in this project includes:

Subscriber Data: Information on subscriber locations, device details, and data usage during the eclipse.
POI Data: Details about Points of Interest in the cities where the eclipse was visible.
Travel Data: Insights into subscriber travel patterns, including starting points, destinations, and modes of transport.
Key Data Files
eclipse_subscriber_data_merged.csv: The primary dataset containing merged data from various sources.
eclipse_subscriber_data_with_times.json: A JSON file with detailed subscriber information and eclipse timings.
Setup
To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your environment as follows:

Prerequisites
